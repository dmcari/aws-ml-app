# Machine Learning App

Flask App template with machine learning prediction. It uses tools from AWS Storage for model and settings retrieving.The process receives a sample data with four attributes and outputs a prediction.
I received this project in an AI course and i've modified the code for making a generic template -still in progress-.
It needs credentials in a config module and can be triggered after building the Docker image.
